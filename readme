PAXOS Application: 

In my application I have three files: 
1. CouncilElection.java: This file has the entry point of the application. Initializes council members, starts threads, and initiates the election process.

2. CouncilMember.java: This file implements the logic for council members. Each member listens for incoming messages, votes, and processes election proposals.

3. CouncilElectionTest.java: It contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the election process under different scenarios.

How to run the application:

1. Open a terminal and compile the source files using javac *.java
2. Run the Application by running the CouncilElection class java CouncilElection
3. Run the Test files to execute the test cases
4. The output will display logs of the election process, including proposals, votes, and the election result. Below is an example of how the output might look:

CouncilMember M1 started and listening on port 5001
CouncilMember M2 started and listening on port 5002
CouncilMember M3 started and listening on port 5003
CouncilMember M4 started and listening on port 5004
CouncilMember M5 started and listening on port 5005
